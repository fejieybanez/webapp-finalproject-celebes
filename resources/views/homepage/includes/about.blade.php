            <h3>Cheat Time Bakehouse-Butuan Premier</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
            The latest sweet hub in the city, aptly name CHEAT TIME BAKE HOUSE, is not a newbie. Even before 
            opening their first physical store, they have since been catering to more than a handful of sweet 
            loving peeps. A pop-up store, as the owners called it, was always flocked even when raining.
             Hence, they opted to open a physical store where everyone can relax and enjoy their sweet treats
              despite the flares of Mother Nature. Sure is cheat time every time at Cheat Time.

         <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
         <p>Celebes is the first company in the Philippines to manufacture and export the Organic Certified Extra Virgin Coconut Oil since 1998. Like the coconut trees that dot the tropical landscape of the Philippines, Celebes stands tall and proud today. 
            Its corporate odyssey began without much fanfare in 1981 when it manufactured wood products from timber sourced from its forest concession in Butuan City, Philippines located in the island of Mindanao.
            Yet from this modest start emerged one of the country’s largest export oriented enterprises, right at the onset of the New Millennium.</p>
