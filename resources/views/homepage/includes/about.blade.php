            <h3>Cheat Time Bakehouse-Butuan Premier</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
            The latest sweet hub in the city, aptly name CHEAT TIME BAKE HOUSE, is not a newbie. Even before 
            opening their first physical store, they have since been catering to more than a handful of sweet 
            loving peeps. A pop-up store, as the owners called it, was always flocked even when raining.
             Hence, they opted to open a physical store where everyone can relax and enjoy their sweet treats
              despite the flares of Mother Nature. Sure is cheat time every time at Cheat Time.
